#User Stories

##This is a list of user requests on how they would like their application to function.

###User story 1.
I would like an application that allows me to select from three possible items that could be purchased in a possible buss mall magazine.

###User story 2.
I would like the application to only show different items and not show items that had just been previously shown.

###User story 3.
I would like the application to not only record which items were chosen but how many times the item was shown to see how frequently it was chosen after being shown.

###User story 4.
I would like the application to show the results of the data to the user, but not until after they have completed the survey so it does not affect how they choose products.
